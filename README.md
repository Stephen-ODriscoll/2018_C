I have created two programs during my C module, a palindrome game and a tic-tac-toe game.

---

Palindrome - 	A palindrome is a number that is the exact same when reversed, e.g. 121, 2332, 42524.
		The aim of this game is to turn the initial number into a palindrome in as little goes as possible.
		You can add or take one from any number and this counts as a go.
		This game can be started by running 2018_C_StephenODriscoll\Assignment - Palindrome\bin\Debug\Palindrome.exe

Tic-tac-toe -	Starts as a simple 3x3 tic-tac-toe (X's and O's) game with 2 players.
		The number of rows and columns can be changed in game.h; e.g. 4x4, 4x5, 5x5 etc.
		The number of symbols in a line required to win can also be changed here. Default is 3 to win.
		This game can be started by running 2018_C_StephenODriscoll\Assignment - Tic Tac Toe\bin\Debug\TicTacToe.exe
